# OPTICAL-DEVICE-SIMULATION-WITH-LUMERICAL
This repository focus on the simulation of optical devices using Lumerical Software 

SOftware LUMERICAL ANSYS 
AIM: Design of a SOI RIB WAVEGUIDE 
Objective:
. Design a SOI RIB waveguide
. Simulate the modal beehaviour of the waveguide
. Carry out Material dispersion on the waveguide
. Perform Frequency sweep on the waveguide and monitor the variation of the effective index ,group index with refractive index of the material
